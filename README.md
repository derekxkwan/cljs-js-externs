# cljs-js-externs
js externs for clojurescript compilation pains

personal-use js externs files mostly generated with [jmmk's javascript externs generator](https://github.com/jmmk/javascript-externs-generator) in various sorts of ways

- ar.ext.js - passes over the AR.js library with the externs generator plus some hand-added entries
- three.ext.js - the cljsjs ext file for Three.js merged with my own pass on Three.js using the externs generator plus some hand-added entries

# cljs-js-externs
js externs for clojurescript compilation pains

personal-use js externs files mostly generated with [jmmk's javascript externs generator](https://github.com/jmmk/javascript-externs-generator) in various sorts of ways

- ar.ext.js - passes over the [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library with the externs generator plus some hand-added entries
- three.ext.js - the [cljsjs ext file](https://github.com/cljsjs/packages/tree/master/three) (as of 7/23/18) for [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) merged with my own pass on Three.js using the externs generator plus some hand-added entries
